# 🚀 Streamlit Community Cloud Deployment Instructions

## Current Status
✅ **All code is ready for deployment**
✅ **All validations pass - Dashboard v2.0 is production-ready**
✅ **All files committed locally with comprehensive bug fixes**

## Manual Push to GitHub Required

The GitHub authentication needs to be resolved manually. Here are the steps:

### 1. Push Local Changes to GitHub
```bash
cd "/Users/hugo/Documents/AIM/Data Analysis"

# Check what needs to be pushed
git log --oneline -3

# Push manually with fresh authentication
git push origin main
```

If authentication fails, you may need to:
- Regenerate the GitHub token with `repo` permissions
- Use GitHub Desktop or VS Code to push
- Or push via SSH if configured

### 2. Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

Once pushed to GitHub:

1. **Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)**
2. **Sign in with GitHub account**
3. **Click "New app"**
4. **Repository**: `hugowalrand/ce-idea-analysis`
5. **Branch**: `main`
6. **Main file path**: `launch_streamlit.py`
7. **Click "Deploy!"**
