Project: CE Idea Interest over Time Analysis

GOALS:
P1: Refine our understanding of how much incubatee's idea preferences change over time
P2: Understand the main drivers behind incubatee's preferences changing
P3: Draw conclusions/recommendations for the different departments based on the data

Process and Summary: 
	•	Ask self: What is a good numerical version of this question? 
	•	Clean data → Try to dust off python/excel skills → find this is slower than I’d hope! :) → Pull what I can with some AI assistance & do visual sweeps 
	•	Got partway through P1. If these skills are needed in what I end up doing, very happy to spend some time refreshing my skills (used to get into flow with this!). Think it would take a few days?  
	•	Answers below to two questions from P1  (i.e., “moved negative→pos” & “did not found program offerings”) P1 
	•	I think the thought that people update from neg to pos may have come from the 2021 round.


SCOPE:
	•	Take 3 hours on Thurs to make as much progress as possible on the above goals, using
	•	All idea data from weekly surveys 2020-H1'2025 Idea Interest Over Time Data for Elizabeth
	•	Note that there's a chance some context in the open-text is sensitive (ie. a person mentions how they feel about another incubatee), although I've tried to clean it. Please use discretion and sensitivity with this data
	•	It might be useful to get some additional "soft" context from me to help you draw conclusions/scope the work further. Can discuss in our chat

I imagine thorough completion of these goals will take more than 3 hours - we can continue the work in projects over the coming weeks if you find it interesting :) My hope is that you can at least 80/20 P1 in 3 hours, but I could be off-base depending on how messy the data is.

Further breakdown of goals/specific data we want to know:
P1: Refine our understanding of how much incubatee's idea preferences change over time
	•	What is the average “trajectory” an incubatee goes through in terms of idea openness
	•	Do they become more or less “open” during the program
	•	If they start negative on an idea, how likely is it they become positive?
Data covered: 2021 - H1’25 (does not include H1’25 pre-program data)
Specific question: If participants provide a negative score (1-3) in week 1, how likely is it they become positive (5-7) on that question at any week? 	
→ Depending on interests, question could be asked differently: E.g., If participants provide a negative score (1-2) in week 1 or 2, how likely is it they resolve positively (6-7) on it in week 4 or 5? 
Instances of participants moving neg → pos

	•	Miri - Tobacco Taxation - Week 1: -2→ Week 2:1
	•	Nicoll - KC 1 - Week 1: -1 → Week 4:1
	•	Victoria - Tobacco Taxation - Week 1: -2 → Week 3: 1
2022
	•	Sarah - Tobacco Taxation - Week 1: -1 → Week 2: 1 → W3 0 
2021
	•	Andres - Fortification feed - Week 1: -3 → Week 2: 0, W3 2, W4 1, W5 0
	•	Devon - Fortification feed - Week 1: -2 → Week 3:1 → W4 0
	•	Isaac - Fortification feed - Week 1: -2 → Week 3: 0, W4 0, W5 3 AND Shrimp Welfare - Week 1: -3 → Week 3: 2, W4 3, W5 3
	•	If they start positive, how likely is it they become negative?
	•	For each idea that has been launched, what was the founders’ journey with that idea?
	•	What was their relative rating of it over the program?
	•	How often do incubatees found ideas that are offered in the program vs not?
Data covered: 2020 - H1’25
Slightly expanded question scope because grabbed it automatically. Includes names of incubatees who were listed as not founding at all. 
	•	Founded idea not in survey 
	•	Tom → Lead Acid Batteries
	•	Micaella → Lead Acid Batteries 
	•	Laura → CBT for Crime Reduction 
	•	Henning → CBT for Crime Reduction 
	•	Tuberculosis → Habiba 
	•	Keyur - Syphilis testing
	•	Nils - Syphilis testing 
	•	Founded own Idea: 
	•	Haindavi → India Welfare Policy 
	•	Uttej - India Welfare Policy 
	•	Nicoll - Nicol’s idea 
	•	Joined other organization 
	•	Joined other organisation 
	•	Adnaan → Joined ARMoR
	•	Lizzie → Joined Ansh 
	•	Stuart → Almost launched CFME, Joined Animal Advocacy Africa 
	•	Jessica → Almost launched CFME, Joined SWP 
	•	Amy → Joined LEEP

	•	Following note on excel to exclude everyone not listed in founding results
		2020
	•	Following note on excel to exclude everyone not listed in founding results
	•	
	•	How convergent are people on cause area? How many truly “agnostic” founders have there been? (how often do people end up only preferring ideas in one cause area)

P2: Understand the main drivers behind incubatee's preferences changing
	•	Using the open-text, pull out sentiment analysis (using AI, likely) to understand the primary reasons people have become more or less excited about ideas
	•	Idea-by-idea, especially for ideas that have not been founded
	•	Across-cohorts or causes (ie. policy ideas)
	•	Are there notable “popularity” effects? Ie. ideas that start more or less popular, middling people updating toward that average more than is normal

P3: Draw conclusions/recommendations for the different departments based on the data
	•	Steve and I communicate that peoples’ preferences change over time; is this actually true?? If not, what might be likely consequences (pos and neg) of communicating the data transparently 
	•	How might this/should this influence either the ideas research recommends (low likelihood this should), or more likely, how we communicate the ideas/supplement the reports pre-or-during program?
	•	How should recruitment update based on this data, both in
	•	Getting a more accurate understanding of people’s likely idea preferences pre-program
	•	How to outreach based on the data
